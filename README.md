# Hubot Markov Model

Generates a markov model based on everything that your Hubot sees in your
chat.

## Installing

1. Add `hubot-markov` to your `package.json` with `npm install --save hubot-markov`:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "hubot-markov": "~1.6.0"
  },
```

2. Require the module in `external-scripts.json`:

```json
["hubot-markov"]
```

3. Run `npm update` and restart your Hubot.

## Commands

Saying anything at all in chat appends to the model. The robot is always
watching!

`Hubot: markov` will randomly generate text based on the current contents of
its model.

`Hubot: markov your mother is a` will generate a random phrase seeded with
the phrase you give it. This command might output "your mother is a classy
lady", for example. Remember: Hubot is an innocent soul, and what he says
only acts as a mirror for everything in your hearts.

`Hubot: remarkov` and `Hubot: mmarkov` are similar, but traverse node transitions in different directions: `remarkov` chains backwards from a given ending state, and `mmarkov` chains both forward and backward.

## Configuring

The Hubot markov model can optionally be configured by four environment
variables:

`HUBOT_MARKOV_PLY` controls the *order* of the model that's built; effectively,
how many previous states (words) are considered to choose the next state. You
can bump this up if you'd like, but the default of 1 is both economical with
storage and maximally hilarious.

`HUBOT_MARKOV_LEARN_MIN` controls the minimum length of a phrase that will
be used to train the model, default 1. Set this higher to avoid training your
model with a bunch of immediate terminal transitions like "lol".

`HUBOT_MARKOV_GENERATE_MAX` controls the maximum size of a markov chain that will be
generated by the "markov" command.

`HUBOT_MARKOV_RESPOND_CHANCE` controls the chance that Hubot will respond
un-prompted to a message it sees by using the last word in the message as the
seed. Set this to a value between 0 and 1.0 to enable the feature. Leaving this
variable unset or setting it to 0 will disable the feature.

`HUBOT_MARKOV_NOREVERSE`, if set, will prevent the reverse model from being generated. This saves some space in your database, but doesn't let you use `remarkov` or `mmarkov`.

`HUBOT_MARKOV_IGNORELIST` is interpreted as a comma-separated list of usernames to ignore for purposes of markov indexing. You can use this to prevent the output of other bots or integrations from clogging up your model. By default, Hubot sees all messages.
